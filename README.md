# RepResearch_Course2

The main objecive of this document is to explain the health and economical impact due to Clima Events in USA. To do it, we'll use the [NOAA Storm Data Base](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2).

Climate Events have got a very remarcable property: ___a great dispersion of impact magnitudes___. This means that we usually find much events with a small or no impact impact and a small portion of total events with high and/or extremelly high impacts.

The first part of the document is dedicated to explore and prepare the data for the analysis of impacts. The second one, is dadicated to explain the results of the analysis in three dimensions:

+ Total impact per Even Type
+ Most harmfull and damage Event Types
+ Evolution in time
